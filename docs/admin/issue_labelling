Description of how we use labels and what they mean. 

Example labels:
P0;  Category: Code;  


== Priority Labels ==

P0: Problem live in 'production' that is currently impacting players, needs immediate fix
P1: Prioritized problem, not currently causing problems, but a fix here should be prioritized
Regression: bug report for a non-released version would get this label. These indicate we messed up during PR, not enough
  testing, or just missed something. If we release a 'regression', it is no longer a regression but probably a p1 or a p0 instead.
  
  
== Categorization Labels ==


category: dev & admin process  - anything that relates to the build scripts, deployment pipeline, any kind of process like how
  we do code reviews or merges, also anything that relates to how we maintain lobby and bots.



== Type Labels ==

Indicates what kind of issues/topic we are looking at. Examples would be performance problems vs security issues. 


== Tracking Labels ==

ice box - revisit later: Used for non-critical items that are not actionable. Essentially this allows us to mark something
  as incomplete and to stop active tracking. These items can still be viewed, and if someone were looking for ideas or
  loose ends to pick up, they could look at these issues. At any time if we want to bring one of these issues back to life
  we can re-open it and remove the 'ice box' label
  
  
== Meta Labels ==
Issues can be tagged with any number of 'meta' labels.

* help needed: means we need volunteers, looking for people to jump in to help
* discussion: indicates the issue is under discussion and action items are not necessarily yet known. "input needed" would
 be a good alternative name
