TripleA can be played over the internet and has a big online community.
For tasks like this we have a couple servers running, which power the lobby, the forum and a dozen bots.

## The Lobby
The Lobby is hosted on the same server as the legacy [tripleawarclub.org](https://tripleawarclub.org) forum, as well as our [dice server](https://dice.tripleawarclub.org).
We use `systemd` to start and stop those services.
```
sudo service triplea-lobby start|stop|status|restart
```
All TripleA related processes are started as the `triplea` user, so if you ever get an error because of insufficient permissions, make sure all the files are owned by the `triplea` user.

The command is pretty much self-explanatory, but be advised, that restarting the lobby quits all connections to all bots.
Even if the lobby restarts, the bots won't reconnect automatically, they will have to be restarted on their own.

_Of course not everyone is permitted to perform such an critical operation. This command is restricted to users with full sudo rights._

## The Dice server
Dice servers are used to ensure integrity of dice rolls for Play-by-E-Mail games in order to prevent cheating.
The code can be found at [our Repository](https://github.com/triplea-game/dice-server), the dice server is written in PHP.
To restart the dice server just run
```
sudo service nginx restart
```
on the tripleawarclub.org/dice.tripleawarclub.org server.

## The Forums
The new forum runs on the NJ server (forums.triplea-game.org), it's powered by NodeBB and written in Node-JavaScript.
It uses a mongo database.
NodeBB is deployed via git and dependencies are installed using npm.

### Restarting
Restarting NodeBB is quite easy. When we have an admin account on the forum, we can restart it using the webinterface.
If this webinterface is not available because of a crash or a bad configuration file, we of course need to do it by hand.

```
sudo service nodebb restart
sudo service nginx restart
```

_Note: Restarting fails sometimes if not enough resources e.g. memory are available. Make sure there is always enough memory available._

### Updating
Updating is not always the same, depending on the branch policy of NodeBB.
You should preferably execute all of the following commands as the `nodebb` user, or make sure all the files belong to the `nodebb` user after upgrading.
```
# First of all shut down the forum.
sudo service nodebb stop

# Make sure you are in the correct working directory
cd /opt/nodebb/

# Sometimes the release branch is changed. In this case we need to do a checkout:
# new_branch_name refers to the branch name of the current release of the NodeBB repository.
# It can be found here: https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB
git fetch --all
git checkout <new_branch_name>

# All of the following commands need to always be executed:

# Pull the latest changes from the remote repository.
git pull
# Install the latest dependencies.
./nodebb upgrade

# Last but definitely not least restart the forum.
sudo service nodebb start
```

### Troubleshooting
If we ever run into problems with the forum and it keeps refusing to start, we need to do a couple things:
Before running any of those commands, we need to be in the correct working directory, `/opt/nodebb/` in our case.
We can do that by executing `cd /opt/nodebb/` in the beginning.
Run `./nodebb upgrade`, this should fix problems most of the time.
If it doesn't, make sure enough memory is available and the database is up and running. (`sudo service mongod status`)
If all of this doesn't help, open an issue at the [NodeBB repository](https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB) or create a topic in the [NodeBB community forum](https://community.nodebb.org).

#### Reading log files
NodeBB uses stdout to log everything.
stdout is attached to journalctl.
jornalctl deletes log files after a couple weeks in order to save space, so don't expect to be able to read every log entry ever created.
To view the latest 50 log lines (because there are A LOT) run `sudo journalctl | grep "nodebb" | tail -n 50`.
This should hopefully help you figuring out the issue.

### Legacy
The old tripleawarclub forum is powered by XOOPS, written in PHP and uses MySQL as Database scheme.
Because of more and more issues with XOOPS we decided to move to the new forum, which is much easier to maintain.
If we ever wanted to restart the forum anyway, we'd just need to restart nginx.
```
sudo service nginx restart
```

## The Bots
The bots are automated TripleA clients which are ready to play a game with anyone who wants.
They are started and stopped similarly to the lobby, and typically require sudo rights to be managed.
On our servers however we granted moderators the right to start and stop those bots, because we don't have the time and the resources to manage everything on our own.
```
sudo service triplea-bot@<bot_number> start|stop|status|restart
```
_bot_number_ is used to make multiple bots possible. I'd recommend having unique bot numbers across all servers to avoid confusion, but unique numbers are only required per server.
The current number scheme is simple:
 - 1 _or 01_ stands for server 0 (tripleawarclub.org) bot number 1.
 - 12 stands for server 1 (NJ/forums.triplea-game.org) bot number 2.
 - 29 stands for server 2 (CA) bot number 9.

etc.
Bots currently use up a lot of RAM, probably too much, this is why only a limited amount of bots can be run on a single server.
Typically 4/5 bots run on a single server each.

Every bot needs its own opened port. We recommend ufw as an easy-to-use tool for managing firewall rules.
The default port is `400${BOT_NUMBER}`, e.g. bot 10 uses port 40010.

### Easy restarting
Sometimes we need to restart all bots at the same time. We could of course just restart each bot individually, but programmers are lazy and that's why there is a simpler method.
On our servers this file exists: `/lib/systemd/system/triplea-bot-starter.service`, and contains something along this content (Of course the bot numbers and counts differ).
```
[Unit]
Description=TripleA Bot Starter

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/echo "Starting TripleA-Bots" ;\
/usr/sbin/service triplea-bot@1 start ;\
/usr/sbin/service triplea-bot@2 start ;\
/usr/sbin/service triplea-bot@3 start ;\
/usr/sbin/service triplea-bot@4 start

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
When enabled using the following commands, the bots are automatically started after every server restart.
```
sudo systemctl enable triplea-bot-starter
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

If we now want to restart all default bots, we run:
```
sudo service triplea-bot@* stop
sudo service triplea-bot-starter restart
```
This launches all default bots we defined in our starter service file.
Depending on how many maps are loaded, it may take up to 10 minutes until the bots are online.

### Updating
We need our script files from the [triplea-game/lobby repository](https://github.com/triplea-game/lobby).
#### TripleA version
From time to time we want to update the bots or the maps to a new TripleA version with potential bug fixes.
Updating is just as easy as installing, the installation process overwrites all the files.
We just run the `install_bots` script after stopping all bots, and we should be able to restart the bots without any further problems afterwards.

#### Maps
The maps files are located at `/home/triplea/bots/maps/` by default along with a `download_all_maps` script file from the lobby repository.
To update all maps we simply do the following:
```
cd /home/triplea/bots/maps/
./download_all_maps
```
Depending on the internet connection this could take a couple minutes.

### Log files
Currently TripleA creates log files on its own without relying on stdout.
If anything ever goes wrong, or we just want to check the log files for another reason, we need to look inside the logs directory of the installation folder.
The log folder is located at `/home/triplea/bots/logs/` by default.

## Setting up a new server
Our [triplea-game/lobby repository](https://github.com/triplea-game/lobby) has a couple of useful scripts which enable you to setup a new server in almost no time.
Those scripts enable you to deploy your own lobby and/or bots.
Read more about setup steps [there](https://github.com/triplea-game/lobby#lobby).
