TODO: the above fields are maybe out of date, particularly the change log parts:
1.	`LATEST=1.8.0.5` -> This should be updated to whatever the newest version is.  This is the key that will tell people on older versions that it is time to upgrade.  
2.	`SHOW_FROM=1.6.1.4` -> This controls how far back the ‘changelog’ that is shown to the player will go.  I generally like to have it go back about 2 year’s worth of changes or so.  
3.	`LINK=https://triplea.sourceforge.net/` and `LINK_ALT=https://sourceforge.net/projects/tripleamaps/files/TripleA/` -> The links given to the player for where to go download the latest version.  
4.	`CHANGELOG=https://svn.code.sf.net/p/triplea/code/trunk/triplea/changelog.txt` -> Link for where to go to see the full changelog (needs to be updated to point to github).  
5.	` NOTES_1.8.0.5=<b style="font-size:120%">TripleA 1.8.0.5</b> (2015-Jan-01) <br><b>- Bug Fixes: </b><br>Savegame size increasing exponentially bug fixed…….`  
  1.	The `NOTES_x.x.x.x=<html>` are the individual release notes for each of the versions, in html form.  Please follow the pattern that has already been established.
