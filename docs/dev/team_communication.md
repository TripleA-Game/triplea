### Github Issues
Primary means of communication is via github issues:
- conversations are open and recorded for historical reference.
- since issues are open, they can be handled by teams of people, no one person is a bottle neck or unable to go on vacation.

### Gitter

Quick 1:1 messages, administrative informational broadcast messages. For example: "Restarting bot 15, looks to be on fire"
  

### Forum

Used to get communicate to the non-technical side of the TripleA community. Good place to get feedback on potential
features or to ask questions to the larger TripleA community.
