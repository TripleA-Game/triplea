# Versioning 

Simplified 3 number versioning system based on semantic versioning:

 
``` release.compatability.build_number```


**Release** - A version number used by the TripleA team for version partitioning. 
**compatability** - Incremented whenever backwards compatibility with previous version is lost
**Build** - auto-generated by the build system.
