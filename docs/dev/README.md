### Git

TripleA repositories may make use of [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (LFS).  In order to work with such a repository, devs will need to have a Git LFS client installed.  Installation instructions for various platforms is available [here](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs#getting-started).

### IDE Plugins

*Eclipse*
  - [Buildship plugin](https://github.com/eclipse/buildship/blob/master/docs/user/Installation.md)
  - [Gradle integration plugin](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/buildship-gradle-integration)

*Netbeans*
  - [Gradle plugin](http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/44510/gradle-support)

*IntelliJ*
  - Plugins:
    - Eclipse Code Formatter : configure in settings to pick up the eclipse xml formatter file.
    - checkstyle-IDEA : in settings select the triplea checkstyle file
    - Save Actions: configure in settings to at least add 'final' to local variables and class variables.

### Gradle - Building and Running the Code

Useful build commands:

```
./gradlew test
./gradlew run
```

## Set up IDE Formatter
See [code format](https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/blob/master/docs/dev/code_format.md)

## Useful Tools

- SCM breeze, useful Git CLI helper: https://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze
- EGit in Eclipse: http://www.eclipse.org/egit/

## Communication

### Github Issues
Primary means of communication is via github issues:
- conversations are open and recorded for historical reference.
- since issues are open, they can be handled by teams of people, no one person is a bottle neck or unable to go on vacation.

### Gitter

Quick 1:1 messages, administrative informational broadcast messages. For example: "Restarting bot 15, looks to be on fire"
  

### Forum

Used to get communicate to the non-technical side of the TripleA community. Good place to get feedback on potential
features or to ask questions to the larger TripleA community.



## TripleA Semantic Versioning 

For simplicity using a 3 number versioning system, with the last number being a build number which is auto-incrementing.

 
``` release.compatability.build_number```

**Release** - A version number used by the TripleA team for version partitioning. Allows the team a manual way to
increase the 'major' version of the release, intended to partition versions and encourage users to update.
**Compatbility** - Incremented whenever backwards compatibility with previous version is lost
**Build** - Final build number is auto-generated by the build system.

## Troubleshooting

Response to a frozen game problem, below are steps notes of what would be needed to debug such a problem:

  - launch the game from a console window, running: ./triplea_unix.sh  | tee output.txt
  - recreate the game freeze.
  - In a second console, "`kill -3`" the process id of the running game. As a one line that would be:
     - `ps -ef | grep java | grep GameRunner | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -3`
  - Go back to the first console, a lot of new text should have shown up. Kill the game (ctrl+c), the file: "`output.txt`" will have the debug data we want.



This page describes the roles in a Pull Request (PR), guidelines for what is expected from code reviewers, how to become one, and guidelines of what is expected from someone that submits code.

# Process

### PR Guidelines
- describe functional changes
- describe what was tested
- describe refactoring that was done
- if UI changes were made, include screen shots giving an overview of how things look
- code contributors should test their updates quite thoroughly


### Code reviewer expectation:
- shall not "self-review" and "self-merge" their own work 

### Requirements for someone to have write access
- contribute some code
- provide valuable code reviews
- sustained engagement over at least a few months

### PR Merge Guidelines

At least one code reviewer must:
- try out any functional changes
- do a thorough code check
Before merge:
- all comments questions should be answered/addressed

### Code Review Ordering
- Reviewers should start with the oldest PRs and work their way forward in time. Favor merging things in that order as well. The reason for the merge order is to make merge conflicts a bit more predictable, if you are the first PR in the queue, then there should be no merge conflicts. If 2nd, then in theory you would only have to worry about the one open PR request to cause merge conflicts.
