# Code Review 

### PR Guidelines
- describe functional changes
- describe what was tested
- describe refactoring that was done
- if UI changes were made, include screen shots giving an overview of how things look
- code contributors should test their updates quite thoroughly

### Code reviewer expectation:
- shall not "self-review" and "self-merge" their own work 

### Requirements for someone to have write access
- contribute some cod
- provide valuable code reviews
- sustained engagement over at least a few months

### PR Merge Guidelines

At least one code reviewer must:
- try out any functional changes
- do a thorough code check
Before merge:
- all comments questions should be answered/addressed

### Code Review Ordering
- Reviewers should start with the oldest PRs and work their way forward in time. Favor merging things in that order as well. The reason for the merge order is to make merge conflicts a bit more predictable, if you are the first PR in the queue, then there should be no merge conflicts. If 2nd, then in theory you would only have to worry about the one open PR request to cause merge conflicts.


# Versioning 

Simplified 3 number versioning system based on semantic versioning:

 
``` release.compatability.build_number```


**Release** - A version number used by the TripleA team for version partitioning. 
**compatability** - Incremented whenever backwards compatibility with previous version is lost
**Build** - auto-generated by the build system.

# Troubleshooting

Response to a frozen game problem, below are steps notes of what would be needed to debug such a problem:

  - launch the game from a console window, running: ./triplea_unix.sh  | tee output.txt
  - recreate the game freeze.
  - In a second console, "`kill -3`" the process id of the running game. As a one line that would be:
     - `ps -ef | grep java | grep GameRunner | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -3`
  - Go back to the first console, a lot of new text should have shown up. Kill the game (ctrl+c), the file: "`output.txt`" will have the debug data we want.
