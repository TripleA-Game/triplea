### TripleA Semantic Versioning 

For simplicity using a 3 number versioning system, with the last number being a build number which is auto-incrementing.

 
``` release.compatability.build_number```

**Release** - A version number used by the TripleA team for version partitioning. Allows the team a manual way to
increase the 'major' version of the release, intended to partition versions and encourage users to update.
**Compatbility** - Incremented whenever backwards compatibility with previous version is lost
**Build** - Final build number is auto-generated by the build system.
