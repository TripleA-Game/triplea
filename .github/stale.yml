  The TripleA team regrets this issue was not solved sooner. To keep focus
  on latest issues and the most pressing tasks, 
  this issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not 
  had recent activity.  If the issue may be closed, please do so. 
  If there are remaining items, we encourage for those items to be 
  resubmitted as new, independent, concise tasks. The strategy
  is divide and conquer. Thank you for your contributions.
