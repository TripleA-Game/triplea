Save game files at the point of a problem help a lot. You can attach them to github issues by zipping them 
up first and then dragging and then dropping them into the github issue using the file attachment links provided by github.

The more detailed information you can provide when reporting problems the easier it is for us to pinpoint them. 
Sometimes we can use exact error messages to search the code base and pinpoint where problems are. 
This leads to faster fixes. The below information and anything more is of great benefit, we 
appreciate you reporting problems to the TripleA team

### Do you have the exact error text? Please copy/paste if so

### Instead of this error, what should have happened?

### Any additional information that may help:
