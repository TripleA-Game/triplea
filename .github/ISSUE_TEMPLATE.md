## Bugs
### Reporting
Please check if this bug has already been reported FIRST, if it hasn't, feel free to proceed.
Make sure to provide all the necessary information we could need when reporting a bug.
This includes:
 - Tell us which version of TripleA you are using. Maybe the bug is already fixed in the latest pre-release.
 - ALWAYS provide steps on how to reproduce. If we don't know what exactly occurred we can't fix it.

### Formatting
In case TripleA opens the console and an error (a so called 'stacktrace') shows up, please post this exact error here, but please keep 2 things in mind:
1. Always put your stacktrace in a code segment, you can do this by simply selecting the whole stacktrace and clicking on the 'Insert Code' button (&lt;&gt;)
2. If your stacktrace is too long, please consider creating a gist on gist.github.com and pasting the code there. This keeps the issue clean and readable. Don't forget linking to your gist.
