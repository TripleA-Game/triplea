# Infrastructure Project

Home to infrastructure deployment, notably done with a technology
called [ansible](https://www.ansible.com)

Infrastructure deployment refers to how we set up and deploy software
to test and production servers.

For more info on how TripleA deploys with ansible, see:
 [Ansible Overview](./docs/ansible-overview.md)

Notably ansible is designed to be idempotent, we run deployments to
prerelease and production on every merge to master. This is triggered
from [travis](https://travis-ci.org/github/triplea-game/triplea) which
builds the TripleA master branch after each PR is merged.

Each ansible 'role' can be thought of as an application that is deployed.
Roles should be pretty atomic and granular so that we can easily configure
and re-use them between different hosts. Each [role folder](./ansible/roles)
should have a README.md file that describes what is deployed by that role.

See the [docs folder](./docs) for various documentation, particularly how to
use a [local vagrant machine](./docs/local-development-with-vagrant.md) to do
deployment automation development locally before needing to merge.
